## Webpack React Basic Configuration Repo

This repo is a sample webpack config to any React application.
This is just for guidance and reference when creating new react project without using any boilerplate.

This doesn't much do on the React behavior or codes rather focuses on different set-up we can do on webpack for React Application during project development.
